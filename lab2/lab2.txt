L.1) List the lab group members who were present for all parts of this lab (including any
follow-up after the class period).
Sarah Reehl
Benjamin Stuermer
Romie Morales Rosado

L.2) List any lab group members who were not present for at least some parts of this lab
(including any follow-up after class), and please clarify the parts they missed.


L.3) How much time, if any, did you need outside of Monday’s class time to complete this assignment. Put “no additional time” if you completed the lab within the scheduled
class period.
4 hours

L.4) How challenging was it for your lab group to coordinate a time to meet after the assigned lab hour?
Moderately

1) If you run your code with all default arguments (using the defaults listed on the 2nd
page of this pdf)
1.1) What is the last epoch of training? (Should be a number between 0 and epochs.)
Epoch 34
1.2) What is the last dev set accuracy obtained (for the epoch in the previous bullet)?
0.91460
1.3) What is the best dev set accuracy obtained (last epoch with badcount=0)?
0.91620

2) If you run your code with all default arguments except you set mb=512)
2.1) What is the last epoch of training? (Should be a number between 0 and epochs.)
Epoch 75 
2.2) What is the last dev set accuracy obtained (for the epoch in the previous bullet)? 
0.90420
2.3) What is the best dev set accuracy obtained (last epoch with badcount=0)?
0.90560
2.4) Does this take more or less wall clock time per epoch than question #1?
less

3) If you run your code with all default arguments except you set lr=0.001
3.1) What is the last epoch of training? (Should be a number between 0 and epochs.)
Epoch 99
3.2) What is the last dev set accuracy obtained (for the epoch in the previous bullet)?
0.89400
3.3) What is the best dev set accuracy obtained (last epoch with badcount=0)?
0.89500

4) If you run your code with all default arguments except you set f1 equal to relu)
4.1) What is the last epoch of training? (Should be a number between 0 and epochs.)
Epoch 32
4.2) What is the last dev set accuracy obtained (for the epoch in the previous bullet)?
0.91860
4.3) What is the best dev set accuracy obtained (last epoch with badcount=0)?
0.92020

5) If you run your code with all default arguments except you set L=200
5.1) What is the last epoch of training? (Should be a number between 0 and epochs.)
Epoch 34
5.2) What is the last dev set accuracy obtained (for the epoch in the previous bullet)?
0.91460
5.3) What is the best dev set accuracy obtained (last epoch with badcount=0)?
0.91620

6) Try tuning the various hyperparameters (e.g. mb, lr) for at least 10 runs and see what
the best dev set performance you can get is. For your best model:
test1: -lr 0.01 -f1 relu 0.91260
test2: -f1 "relu" -lr 0.01 -epochs 200 -mb 256 -L 300 0.89360
test3: -f1 relu -patience 20 0.92340
test4: -f1 "relu" -lr 0.01 -epochs 200 -mb 256 -L 10 0.89460
test5: -f1 sigmoid -lr 0.01 -epochs 100 -mb 256 -L 784 0.89640
test6: -f1 sigmoid -patience 10 0.91620
test7: -f1 relu -patience 30 0.92340
test8: -f1 sigmoid -patience 20 0.91620
test9: -f1 relu -patience 20 -lr 0.001 0.87840
test10: -f1 sigmoid -lr 0.001 -patience 20 0.89500

6.1) What hyperparameters got you the best performance?
-f1 relu -patience 20 
6.2) What is the best dev set accuracy obtained (last epoch with badcount=0)?
0.92340
